    <h1 class="skibidi">The History Of Heavy Metal</h1>
    <br>
    <h1 class="one">The Early 80's</h2>
    <h3 class="b">The early 80s was the fall off of Glam Metal and the rise of what is viewed as many as the best most influential subgenre of metal, Thrash. Thrash is commonly characterized by its insanely fast guitar and drums, and its catchy riffs. The “Big 4” of Thrash consists of Metallica, Megadeth (Formed by Dave Mustaine after being fired from Metallica), SLAYERRR, and Anthrax.  These 4 bands single handedly rebirthed metal as a whole and created some of the most iconic metal tracks ever with songs like “Master of Puppets” and “Raining Blood”. The influence of the bands that came out of this era cannot be understated and they deserve all the respect they get.</h3>

    <h2 class="a">The Late 80's</h2>
    <h3 class="b">The late 80s saw metal shift back into its glam phase and out of it's far superior thrash phase. One major thing to note is that the Glam from the late 80s was much heavier than 70s Glam due to the profound influence of the thrash era that came before them. This era gave birth to bands like Motley Crue and Def Leppard who took the heavy thrash sound and incorporated it into their otherwise poppy music. </h3>
