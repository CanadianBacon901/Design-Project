    <h2 class="one">The 2020's</h2>
    <h3 class="b">The 2020s, for now, our journey comes to an end. The 2020s continued to produce more extreme music. Pushing the boundaries of noise vs music. Demon-like vocals similar to those present in Slaughter To Prevail are common in this decade. Bands like Spirit Box are slowly but surely pushing our genre back into the mainstream while Lorna Shore and Whitechapel keep the more extreme side of the genre alive and well. I hope that this journey has been as fun to read as it was to write. If you enjoyed it, thanks! If you think something can be improved, please fill out a quick form telling me what that is. Rock on <br> NUmetal is the superior genre donâ€™t let anyone say otherwise</h3>
