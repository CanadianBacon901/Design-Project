    <h1 class="skibidi">The History Of Heavy Metal</h1>
    <br>
    <h2 class="one">The 60's</h2>
    <h3 class="b">Our journey begins in 1968. This was the begining of bands like Def Leppard and Deep Purple. These bands introduced the concept of heavy guitar and drums into music. Bands like Def Leppard brought speed to the table while bands like Deep Purple really milked the chugging guitar sound. But perhaps the most influental band to come out of this era was Black Sabbath. Without Black Sabbath, there would be no heavy metal as we know it today. Black Sabbath, with the release of their debut album, revolutionized heavy music. They had complex drum patterns and riffs. It was most people's fisrt time expericing musi where it wa lmost as if more emphasis and effort were put on the band than the lyrics and vocals. The 60's may not have the most produced or modern sounding music, but without this decade, there would be no heavy metal today.</h3>
